# Sentiment Calculator

This repository contains my experiments in building custom sentiment analysis models.  
Models include:
- BiLSTM with attention
- Transformer encoder
- Hybrid architectures  
- Custom dataset preprocessing with text chunking  

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kreyesp/Sentiment-Calculator.git
